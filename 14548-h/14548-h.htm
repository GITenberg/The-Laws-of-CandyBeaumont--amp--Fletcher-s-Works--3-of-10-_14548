<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>Sir, you're the very friend I wish'd to meet with,<br />
I have a large discourse invites your ear<br />
To be an Auditor.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>And what concerns it?<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>The sadly thriving progress of the loves<br />
Between my Lord, the Prince, and that great Lady,<br />
<a name="ref237-9"></a>Whose insolence, and never-yet-match'd Pride,<br />
Can by no Character be well exprest,<br />
But in her only name, the proud <i>Erota</i>.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>Alas, <i>Melitus</i>, I should guess the best<br />
Success your Prince could find from her, to be<br />
As harsh as the event doth prove: but now<br />
'Tis not a time to pity passionate griefs,<br />
When a whole Kingdom in a manner lyes<br />
Upon its Death-Bed bleeding.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>Who can tell<br />
<a name="ref237-19"></a>Whether or no these plagues at once<br />
Hang over this unhappy Land for her sake<br />
That is a Monster in it?<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>Here's the misery<br />
Of having a Child our Prince; else I presume<br />
The bold <i>Venetians</i> had not dar'd to attempt<br />
So bloody an invasion.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>Yet I wonder<br />
Why (Master Secretary) still the Senate<br />
So almost superstitiously adores<br />
<i>Gonzalo</i>, the <i>Venetian</i> Lord, considering<br />
The outrage of his Countrymen--<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>The Senate<br />
Is wise, and therein just, for this <i>Gonzalo</i>,<br />
Upon a Massacre performed at Sea<br />
By the Admiral of <i>Venice</i>, on a Merchant<br />
Of <i>Candy</i>, when the cause was to be heard<br />
Before the Senate there, in open Court<br />
Professed, that the cruelty the Admiral<br />
Had shewed, deserved not only fine, but death;<br />
For <i>Candy</i> then, and <i>Venice</i> were at peace:<br />
Since when upon a motion in the Senate,<br />
For Conquest of our Land, 'tis known for certain,<br />
That only this <i>Gonzalo</i> dar'd to oppose it,<br />
His reason was, because it too much savour'd<br />
Of lawless and unjust ambition.<br />
The Wars were scarce begun, but he (in fear<br />
Of quarrels 'gainst his life) fled from his Country,<br />
And hither came, where (to confirm his truth)<br />
I know, (<i>Melitus</i>,) he out of his own store,<br />
Hath monied <i>Cassilanes</i> the General.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>What, without other pledges than <i>Cassilanes</i><br />
Bare promise of payment?<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>No, it may be<br />
<a name="ref238-15"></a>He has some [pe]tty Lordship to retire to;<br />
<a name="ref238-16"></a>But thus he hath done; now 'tis fit, <i>Melitus</i>,<br />
The Senate should be thankful, otherwise<br />
They should annihilate one of those Laws<br />
For which this Kingdome is throughout the World<br />
Unfollowed and admired.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>
<a name="ref238-21"></a>What Laws are those, Sir?<br />
Let me so much importune you.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>You shall,<br />
And they be worth your knowledge: briefly thus:<br />
Who e'r he be that can detect apparently<br />
Another of ingratitude, for any<br />
Received Benefit, the Plaintiff may<br />
Require the Offenders life; unless he please<br />
Freely and willingly to grant remission.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>By which strict Law, the Senate is in danger,<br />
Should they neglect <i>Gonzalo</i>?<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>Right, the Law<br />
Permits a like equality to Aliens,<br />
As to a home-bred Patriot.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>Pray Sir, the other?<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>Know, <i>Melitus</i>,<br />
The elder <i>Cretans</i> flourished many years,<br />
In War, in Peace unparallel'd, and they<br />
(To spur heroic Spirits on to Vertue)<br />
Enacted that what man so ere he were,<br />
Did noblest in the field against his enemy,<br />
So by the general voice approv'd, and known,<br />
Might at his home-return, make his demand<br />
For satisfaction, and reward.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">

Your presence.<br />

<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>These Letters<br />
Will shew the causes why.<br />

Doth promise some good tidings.<br />

And happiest for this land that e'r was told!<br />
All the <i>Venetian</i> Forces are defeated.<br />

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>How, Sir?<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>And what doth add some delight more,<br />
There is amongst the Souldiers a contention<br />
Who shall be the triumpher, and it stands<br />
Doubtful between a Father and his Son,<br />
Old <i>Cassilanes</i>, and young <i>Antinous</i>.<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Melitus</p>Why may not both demand it?<br />
</div>

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Gaspero</p>The Law denies it,<br />
But where the Souldiers do not all consent,<br />
The Parties in contention, are refer'd<br />
To plead before the Senate; and from them<br />
Upon an open audience to be judg'd<br />
The Chief, and then to make demands.<br />

Whose confidence thou hast bewitch'd, should see<br />

<div class="sp">
<p class="speaker">Antinous</p>Sir,<br />
For proof that I acknowledge you the Author<br />
Of giving me my Birth, I have discharg'd<br />
A part of my Obedience. But if now<br />
You should (as cruel fathers do) proclaim<br />
Your right, and Tyrant-like usurp the glory<br />
Of my peculiar honours, not deriv'd<br />
From successary, but purchas'd with my bloud,<br />

<p class="speaker">Antinous</p>Sir, hear me: were there not a Chronicle<br />
Well pen'd by all their tongues, who can report<br />
What they have seen you do; or had you not<br />
Best in your own performance writ your self,<br />
And been your own text, I would undertake<br />
Alone, without the help of Art, or Character,<br />
But only to recount your deeds in Arms,<br />
And you should ever then be fam'd a President<br />
Of living victory: But as you are<br />
Great, and well worthy to be stiled Great,<br />
It would betray a poverty of Spirit<br />
In me to obstruct my fortunes, or descent,<br />
If I should coward-like surrender up<br />
The interest which the inheritance of your vertue<br />
And mine own thrifty fate can claim in honour:<br />
My Lord, of all the mass of Fame, which any<br />
That wears a Sword, and hath but seen me fight,<br />
Gives me, I will not share, nor yield one jot,<br />
One tittle.<br />

Been slothful, and not follow'd you in all<br />
The streights of death, you might have justly then<br />
Reputed me a Bastard: 'tis a cruelty<br />

The life of my yet infant-honour from me.<br />

<p class="speaker">Cassilanes</p>
<i>Antinous</i>, look upon this badge of age,<br />
Thy Father's grey-hair'd beard: full fifty years,<br />
(And more than half of this, ere thou wert born)<br />
I have been known a Souldier, in which time<br />
I found no difference 'twixt War and Peace,<br />
For War was Peace to me, and Peace was War.<br />
<i>Antinous</i>, mark me well; there hath not liv'd<br />
These fifty years a man whom <i>Crete</i> prefer'd<br />
Before thy Father; let me boldly boast,<br />
<a name="ref241-40"></a>Thy Father, both for Discipline a[n]d Action<br />

<a name="ref245-7"></a>As if I could have been a second Nature,<br />

As by my exhortation, I gave life<br />
To quicken courage, to inflame revenge,<br />
To heighten resolution; in a word,<br />
To out-doe action: It boots not to discover,<br />
How that young man, who was not fledg'd nor skill'd<br />

As childish: But I list not to disparage<br />
His non-ability: The signal given<br />
Of Battel, when our enemies came on,<br />
<a name="ref245-18"></a>(Directed more by fury, than by warrant<br />

I in the fore-front of the Armies met them;<br />

Had been compos'd of cannon-proof, I stood<br />
The volleys of their shot. I, I my self<br />
Was he that first dis-rankt their woods of Pikes:<br />
But when we came to handy-stroaks, as often<br />
As I lent blows, so often I gave wounds,<br />
And every wound a death. I may be bold<br />
To justifie a truth, this very sword<br />
Of mine slew more than any twain besides:<br />
And, which is not the least of all my glorie,<br />
When he, this young man, hand to hand in fight,<br />
Was by the General of the Venetians,<br />
And such as were his retinue, unhors'd,<br />
I stept between, and rescu'd him my self,<br />
Or horses hoofs had trampled him to dirt;<br />
And whilst he was re-mounting, I maintain'd<br />
The combate with the gallant General,<br />
Till having taken breath, he throng'd before me,<br />
Renew'd the fight, and with a fatal blow,'<br />
Stole both that honour from me, and his life<br />
From him, whom I before my self alone,<br />
Had more than full three quarters kill'd: a man<br />
Well worthy only by this hand to have dy'd,<br />
Not by a Boys weak push: I talk too much,<br />
But 'tis a fault of age: If to bring home<br />
Long peace, long victorie, even to your Capitol;<br />
If to secure your Kingdom, wives, and children,<br />
Your lives and liberties; if to renown<br />
Your honours through the world, to fix your names,<br />
Like Blazing stars admir'd, and fear'd by all<br />
That have but heard of <i>Candy</i>, or a <i>Cretan</i>,<br />

Of all what I have done, I shall give instance<br />
Only in three main proofs of my desert.<br />

My Lords judge ye) the chief, the great Commander,<br />

The bold Venetians doubling strength and courage<br />
Had got the better of the day; our men<br />
Supposing that their adversaries grew<br />
Like <i>Hydra's</i> head, recoyle, and 'gan to flye:<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
